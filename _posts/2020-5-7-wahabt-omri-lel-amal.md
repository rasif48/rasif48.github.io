translation: Omar H
english: "<p>
I endowed 'dedicated' my life for hope; hope has never come<br>
And I flooded my land with my sweat; I never harvested <br>
<br>
And I took care of my beloved; they have never cared<br>
My night has become endless <br>
And I am the broken<br>
I know my remedy but the dr. Doesn't want i take it<br>
Where is patience?<br>
<br>
Oh long years and night, where is patience?<br>
Like a strong tall camel, where is patience?<br>
It (the camel) will fall down if it carries one part of my burden, <br>
<br>
But, each morning I neglect my worries, <br>
And with my axe I engrave my songs on the fields: <br>
Ya Leil Ya Ein <br>
<br>
Oh, how beautiful is the plowed land<br>
Through its ruts longing is revealed<br>
<br>
I embraced you after seeds had been sprinkled, and I sang<br>
I sang my feelings to you, <br>
<br>
Only to the land that we keep our love despite time, <br>
And love is beautiful, <br>
Love is beautiful but hardship is more overwhelming, <br>
Our sight is very strong but the clouds suffocate us;<br>
For waiting for promises is like being burnt with flames, <br>
When the plants will grow up? It has been so long! <br>
<br>
I miss my sweetheart but she doesn't miss me; humiliation is bad<br>
Humiliation is bad and our land is a decent lady, <br>
At the day of harvesting, there is a bride with Hinnah on her hands, <br>
If i see her from behind the wheat spikes, i would lay down my Abaya  and date her, <br>
I date the mother of spikes <br>
<br>
And it is then, after a long time waiting and longing, I would embrace my hope with my eyes and hands<br>
<br>
With my sweaty hands, oh sickles, I fold my darkness with a rushing morning, <br>
<br>
And i throw my pessimism on the Crow <br>
And then: we either work hard and sing all the time, <br>
Or, we bravely revolt. <br>
<br>
A promise is a debt! <br>
A promise is a debt! (English idiom: A promise is a promise)<br>
</p>"
